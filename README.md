//Mini Challenge 4 - Greater than or less than
//This program will ask for 2 numbers to be input and then
//say if the first is less than or greater than and then
//say if the second is less than or greater than
//Peer review -  Elizar Garcia, Code was done beautifully. Easy to use and follow. I really like how for the validation it says "please enter a number, not a string:". Gave it a "if you know, you know" feel to it. I also like how the variables were declared above their while loops instead of all on top. Very well organized! Great job!
